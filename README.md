# Project 4 - group 1

## Project overview

Using a dataset solve, analyze, or visualize a problem using machine learning (ML) with the other technologies we’ve learned. Here are the specific requirements:

1) Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.

2) Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we’ve learned.

3) You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.

4) Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

5) You must use at least two of the following:

    * Python Pandas

    * Python Matplotlib

    * HTML/CSS/Bootstrap

    * JavaScript Plotly

    * JavaScript Leaflet

    * SQL Database

    * MongoDB Database

    * Google Cloud SQL

    * Amazon AWS

    * Tableau

## The data set

Using the following dataset charity_data, we will compare how effective machine learning is compared to other visualization tools.

## Project outline 

We will be focussing our findings on answering the following questions:

Tableau shows us that around 75-80% of campaigns were classified as successful, so how can machine learning make this % better?

What will machine learning do to predict a successful campaign?

Can machine learning predict a higher success rate? If so then what do the successful campaigns need?

Is the succes rate prediction in machine learning the same as what the data in Tableau has shown?

## Findings 

## Limitations regarding the data set

1) This is existing data

2) There are no dates regarding when funding was granted
